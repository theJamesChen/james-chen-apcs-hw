What is the difference between the HashMap and HashSet (or the TreeMap and TreeSet) from a user point of view?

     Hashmap:
     In a map, you store key-value pairs.
     HashMap is a implementation of Map interface
     HashMap Stores data in form of  key value pair
     Put method is used to add element in map
     In hash map hashcode value is calculated using key object
     HashMap is faster than hashset because unique key is used to access object

     Hashset:
     In a set, you store only the keys.
     HashSet is an implementation of Set Interface
     HashSet Store only objects
     Add method is used to add element is Set
     HashSet is slower than Hashmap


Internally, how is a HashMap implemented?
	    Hashmap is implemented as an array whose elements point to a linked list.

Internally, how is the TreeMap implemented?
	    TreeMap is internally implemented as a black-red tree.

Speed comparison between HasMaps and TreeMaps.
      HashMap seems to be faster than TreeMap.

Java has a built in Heap data structure but it's not named Heap. What is it?

      PriorityQueue.
