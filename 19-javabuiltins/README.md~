What is the difference between the HashMap and HashSet (or the TreeMap and TreeSet) from a user point of view?

Hashmap:
In a map, you store key-value pairs.
HashMap is a implementation of Map interface
HashMap Stores data in form of  key value pair
Put method is used to add element in map
In hash map hashcode value is calculated using key object
HashMap is faster than hashset because unique key is used to access object

Hashset:
In a set, you store only the keys.
HashSet is an implementation of Set Interface
HashSet Store only objects
Add method is used to add element is Set
HashSet is slower than Hashmap


Internally, how is a HashMap implemented
